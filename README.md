# The Neverer
## Overview
The "Neverer" crossword creator is a free crossword creator, written in C#, and aimed at the creation of standard and cryptic crosswords.

## Usage
The Neverer is designed to be built from source in Visual Studio - or use one of the supplied binaries.

## Installation
If you use one of the supplied binaries, you will have the usual issues around running unsigned code on Windows. Sorry, but I don't currently think it's cost-effective to buy a code-signing certificate each year just to keep this hobby going! If anyone is regularly using the software and wants to fund a certificate, do get in touch!

## Licence
The Neverer is licensed under the MIT licence. You can do what you like with it. If you're interested in contributing, it'd be fun to make it more awesomer together.
